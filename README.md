# Dynamic Web Tableaux for Public Announcement Logic

A web-based implementation of my 'dynamic' tableau system for public announcement logic. I explain some keywords below. I will expand this README in the future!

# What's Public Announcement Logic?

Public announcement logic is a logic for reasoning about knowledge and public announcements. Public announcements are a form of learning where all agents simultaneously acquire common knowledge of a particular fact.

# What are Tablau Systems?

Tableau systems are formal systems for constructing models that satisfy a given formula. They can also be used for proving theorems on the assumption that a formula is a theorem iff no model can be found (which is the case here).

# What are Dynamic Tableaux?

In my dissertation (a work in progress) I describe tableau systems for various dynamic modal logic, including public announcement logics. These tableau systems have rules that closely mirror the 'dynamic' semantics of dynamic modal logics.
